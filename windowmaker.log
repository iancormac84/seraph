6f3efa509329076debb2b3cb4e5177afafc61a22: First commit. Going to try to implement Unreal Engine 4's windowing systems. Of course, this wouldn't be a good idea to use in code in my game engine, but this is for testing purposes.
0dd2d546b17e026f7280c3c3327e5be2e9820d65: Implemented a lot of the Unreal Engine 4 FWindowsWindow API. I have to decide whether to make some of the methods be part of a trait so that I can implement them for other platform specific data structures. It compiles successfully, by the way.
cd13e9a0fab39920912ba0dd216d0507eb2a1464: Implemented part of FWindowsApplication. It has many different parts to it that I most likely will have to stub out for now. I'm working towards testing the message handling system to see if my hack with the IWindowsMessageHandler trait will work. I probably am going to implement the FWindowsWindow::Initialize method next.
cb91d9aabab31499d450e63e85017c4cf8a88da4: Restructured the crate structure so that all the code isn't contained in one monolothic file. I have a preliminary structure set up for cross-platform implementations of everything needed for a native windowing library. This work came after a long struggle with trying to implement IDropTarget for WindowsWindow. I have an idea to create a thread-local storage container with static bounds that will allow me to access the WindowsWindow's OLE reference count variable and other stuff. Don't know if it will work. If it compiles, I'll feel pretty badass. If a test program runs, I'll feel I'm on my way to important breakthroughs about Rust.
